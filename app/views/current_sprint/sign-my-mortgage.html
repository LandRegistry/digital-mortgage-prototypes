			Use this service to view and check your mortgage details are correct. The online deed is not the legal mortgage. You should still sign and return your paper mortgage deed following the instructions you have from your conveyancer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once all parties have signed the paper mortgage your conveyancer will then ensure the Land Registry is updated.
		</p>

		<p>To do this you will need:</p>

		<ul class="list list-bullet">
			<li>a unique borrower reference sent to you by your coveyancer</li>
			<li>the mobile phone you registered with your conveyancer</li>
		</ul>
