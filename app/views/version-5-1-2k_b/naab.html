	<h1 class="heading-xlarge">Network Access Agreement</h1>

<h2 class="heading-large">Terms of use</h2>
<p class="lede">This service can only be used to view and sign a deed, using an electronic signature supplied by the Chief Land Registrar (‘Land Registry’).</p>

<p>To use this service, you must:</p>
				<ul class="list list-bullet">

</ul>
<P>Tell Land Registry (by calling 0300 006 0411) if you think someone else has your security details.</p>


<p>This agreement only exists between you and Land Registry while you use this service to view and sign a deed.
It stops automatically if you die or become bankrupt during this time.</p>
<p>Land Registry can stop providing this service at any time if it believes this action is necessary. </p>

<p> Land Registry may change the terms of this agreement but they will not change whilst you are viewing or signing your deed.</p>


<h2 class="heading-large">Your liability </h2>
<p>You will have to compensate Land Registry for any loss and damage it suffers as a direct result of you:</p>

				<ul class="list list-bullet">
					<li>misusing this service, either intentionally, recklessly or through negligence</li>
					<li>otherwise acting negligently</li>
					<li>using the service without meeting the conditions in this agreement</li>
					<li>misrepresenting your identity</li>
				</ul>

<p>You will also have to compensate Land Registry if someone else makes a claim against it
for loss or damage they suffer as a direct result of these actions, but that compensation will be reduced if Land Registry has caused any of the loss.</p>

<h2 class="heading-large">Land Registry’s liability</h2>

<p>When you use this service, this agreement does not give Land Registry a duty of care or contractual obligation to anyone else. </p>
<p>Where it is at fault, Land Registry’s standard legal requirement to pay compensation for losses or damages doesn’t change.</p>
<p>There is no limit on compensation for:</p>

				<ul class="list list-bullet">
				<li>death or personal injury resulting from Land Registry’s negligence, or</li>
<li>acts or omissions it makes in bad faith</li></ul>

<p>Additionally, Land Registry will compensate you for costs and expenses you incur as a direct result if it acts wrongly under the law, provided these total more than £120 but less than £250.
<p>It doesn’t have to pay compensation for losses or damages caused by:</p>

				<ul class="list list-bullet">
				<li>
any action it takes as the registrar, by law or which it is entitled to make according to this agreement</li>
<li>you breaking the terms of this agreement or the law, unless that happened because Land Registry broke this agreement or failed in its duties</li>
<li>loss or corruption of information on your computer or device</li>
<li>any damage caused to your computer or device as a result of you failing to provide up-to-date anti-virus measures software</li>

</ul>

<p>Land Registry’s employees and agents are not personally liable for any loss or damage you or anyone else suffers, unless they have acted in bad faith.</p>

<p>Land Registry is not liable for inaccurate information supplied by the service except where compensation is required by law.</p>
